# NER
In this Notebook, I explain what Named Entity Recognition is, and how it works. The example is demonstrated with a sentence taken from a public source, and an article from an online media. I use both NLTK and SpaCy libraries to preprocess data, to explain language elements, and to make the computer to name recognized entities.
